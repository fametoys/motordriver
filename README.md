# Hello Fame Toys® fans!

In this GitHub web page, you can download the sample code file "MotorDriver.py" to your Raspberry Pi's micro-SD card.

First of all, you can find useful videos at www.fame.toys and complete steps so your Raspberry Pi is ready for playing with your Fame Toys® Bridger Trains model. Once you watch the videos and get your Raspberry Pi ready to play, you can download this sample code file to your Raspberry Pi desktop.

# Are you ready? 

Hook up Robohat on top of Raspberry Pi. Connect a DC motor to Robohat's Motor 1 output and another DC motor to Robohat's Motor 2 output. Place the x6 AA single-use batteries to the battery holder and connect it to Robohat to turn on Raspberry Pi. Put all the electronics into your model. Download this file on Raspberry Pi desktop and run it.

Enjoy!
